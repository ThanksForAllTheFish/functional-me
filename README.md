# Nothing so serious

While reading [Function Thinking](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029687.do) I start wondering if I could learn more trying stuff on my own. I am currently in [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) and [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), so I try to document everything I am trying here.
